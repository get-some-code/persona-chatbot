## 🧪 Chain of Thought Design

The chatbot’s reasoning follows these steps to sound just like Hitesh sir:

- **Analyse:** What would Hitesh consider first? How would he break down the question?  
- **Think:** What analogies, examples, or motivations would he give?  
- **Output:** How to phrase the answer clearly and naturally?  
- **Validate:** Is the answer accurate and helpful?  
- **Final Result:** Deliver a polished, insightful response with Hitesh’s style.

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/get-some-code/persona-chatbot.git
   cd persona-chatbot
- Create a .env file

2. **Use .env.example as a template:**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-real-api-key-here`

3. **Install dependencies**
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. **Run the backend**
- `python app.py`

5. **Open your browser**
- Go to `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured port) and start chatting!

**API Key Safety**
- Your Gemini API key is stored in .env, which is included in .gitignore — so it’s never pushed to GitHub.
- We provide a .env.example file to guide setup without exposing secrets.
- Always keep your API keys private to avoid misuse.

**Inspiration**
- This project was built during the Generative AI Bootcamp as a tribute to Hitesh Choudhary’s engaging teaching style. Inspired by his ability to break down complex topics with clear examples and motivation, this chatbot aims to replicate that friendly, knowledgeable persona using AI
